# 🔧 Installation & Usage
Installation (Sending to Calculator)
Save the program file as math_trainer_lite.py on your computer.
Open TI Connect CE (v5.6 or later required for Python support).
Go to the Content Explorer tab (shows your calculator’s files).
Drag and drop the .py file onto your calculator’s name.

⚠️ Do not use “Send to Calculators” (this converts it to .8xp which only works for TI-BASIC).

The file should transfer as a Python AppVar, not a Program.

## Running on Calculator

On your TI-84 Plus CE Python, press the [APPS] button.
Select the Python app.
Your file (e.g., math_trainer_lite) should appear in the script list. You can choose to rename it when you send the program to your calculator.
Select it → press ENTER → then choose MENU → Run.
Follow the on-screen prompts to start training!
